My new project which is  to estimate the real estate price of the locations present in Pune city. This project is build step by step using:

(i) sklearn
(ii) Linear regression model

1.The dataset which is required for this model has been downloaded from kaggle.com, which is an amazing site to obtain informative dataset, and to explore more such data science related projects.

2.The next step is to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests, after that i have completed the front-end..
