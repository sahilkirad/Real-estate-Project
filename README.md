My new project which is  to estimate the real estate price of the locations present in Pune city. This project is build step by step using:

(i) sklearn
(ii) Linear regression model 
<br>

1.The dataset which is required for this model has been downloaded from kaggle.com, which is an amazing site to obtain informative dataset, and to explore more such data science related projects.
<br>

2.The next step is to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests, after that i have completed the front-end, using html, css and javascript that allows the user to enter home square feet area, number of bedrooms, etc. details and it call later call the python flask server in order to predict the home price.
<br>

3.In this model building process, i explored various topics related to data science such as data cleaning, data analyzation, outlier detection and removal, etc. 
<br>

Summary of all components used:
<br>
4.Python libraries such as matplotlib for data visualization, numpy and pandas for data cleaning,sklearn for model building, python flask for handling the http server request, Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE.
